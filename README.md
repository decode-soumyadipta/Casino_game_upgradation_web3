## Project Overview

This project aims to upgrade an existing Casino Game platform that was initially developed for the Solana blockchain. The upgrade will modernize the codebase, implement smart contracts for both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, and enhance the user experience with a modern frontend framework.

### Current State

The current platform is a casino/roulette game with the following characteristics:

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with jQuery
- **Blockchain Integration**: Basic Solana integration without smart contracts
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO

### Upgrade Goals

1. **Smart Contract Implementation**:
   - Develop secure smart contracts for Ethereum (Solidity)
   - Develop secure programs for Solana (Rust)
   - Implement proper escrow mechanisms and payment management
   - Ensure fair game outcomes with verifiable randomness

2. **Frontend Modernization**:
   - Migrate from Vanilla JS to Next.js with TypeScript
   - Implement responsive and modern UI components
   - Enhance user experience with proper state management
   - Support multiple wallet connections (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.)

3. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Update API endpoints to interact with smart contracts
   - Improve security measures
   - Optimize database queries and structure
   - Enhance logging and monitoring
